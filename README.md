# Clerk Uploadthing Middleware Clash

1. Copy .env.example and fill in environment variables
2. Install dependencies

	```
	pnpm i
	```

3. Head to http://localhost:3000/example-uploader and you'll be forced to login as it is not a public route

4. Try uploading a file and on the client you'll recieve an error:
	
	```
	ERROR! Failed to get presigned URLs
	```

5. In the terminal recieved error:

	```
	[UT] UploadThing dev server is now running!
[UT] middleware failed to run
Error: You need to use "authMiddleware" (or the deprecated "withClerkMiddleware") in your Next.js middleware file. You also need to make sure that your middleware matcher is configured correctly and matches this route or page. See https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/get-started-with-nextjs

> üôè I'd really appreciate your help with this ‚Äì below I've listed a few thoughts, but the engineer in me would love to know why this is happening!

### Thoughts

- I have authMiddleware at `src/middleware.ts`
- I think it is a middleware clash between the Clerk and Uploadthing, or an incoming callback / webhook
- I can reach `http://localhost:3000/api/uploadthing` with a GET request and recieve:

	```json
	[
	  {
	    "slug": "imageUploader",
	    "config": {
	      "image": {
	        "maxFileSize": "4MB",
	        "maxFileCount": 1
	      }
	    }
	  }
	]
	```

- I've noticed on Vercel sometimes APIs are called `<domain>/en/api/<slug>` and wonder if that has any implication
